# Documentation Workflow

## Goals

- Update docs to match current behavior and CLI usage.
- Prefer examples that are minimal and copy/paste runnable.
- Avoid exposing sensitive or real banking data; use synthetic examples.

## What to update

- README.md (project overview, install, quickstart, CLI examples)
- MkDocs pages (if present) under `docs/` or configured directory
- API docs generated by mkdocstrings (if used)

## Rules for examples

- Use Python 3.13 in doc snippets where version matters.
- Use the published CLI entrypoint: `data-processing ...`
- Prefer small examples using Polars/DuckDB with synthetic data.

## Validation

- Run any docs build/validation that exists in the repo.
- If a docs formatter/validator is used (e.g., flowmark), run it as part of validation.

## PR output

- Provide:
  - Summary of what changed and why
  - Links to updated pages/files
  - Any commands used to validate docs
